                                <p>Keeping your family safe during the pandemic is the number one priority. We are
                                    ensuring social distancing, regular hand washing, disinfecting high touch surfaces
                                    etc. However, when we look around our home and see a dozen of surfaces and
                                    touchpoints that need constant sanitization and cleaning, we are forced to think if
                                    we are doing enough.</p>
                                <p>With things gradually re-opening in our country, we are going out for essentials and
                                    about our daily jobs. While it is safest to stay home, we do need to step out time
                                    to time to go about our daily life, and this increases our chances of contracting
                                    infections. Thorough home cleaning, room cleaning and disinfecting high touch
                                    surfaces at home is the need of the hour.</p>

                                    <li>It is very important to have a well-ventilated facility, so make sure you are in
                                        a well-ventilated area when you clean your home.</li>
                                    <li>Microfibre cloths are also considered more effective at removing soil and dirt
                                        from surfaces but need to be changed frequently to avoid cross-contamination.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Use mops and buckets to clean floors and marble tiles using a disinfectant

                                    <li>There are many areas in our home with dust and other contaminated particles that
                                        might be out of reach and in narrow corners of our home and to effectively clean
                                        from those areas, a handy and portable vacuum cleaner is a must.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p><b>How useful is vacuum cleaner?</b></p>

                                    homes for daily routines, work and even special occasions. Due to safety reasons,
                                    personal vehicles have become a preferred choice of commuting compared to the option
                                    of public cabs.</p>
                                <p>While people are wary of the possible health threats inside their houses and
                                    outdoors, they tend to overlook their personal vehicles, which could be a breeding
                                    ground for bacteria and viruses.</p>
                                <p><b>Importance of car disinfection</b></p>
                                <p>One of the easiest ways of car disinfection is using a powerful disinfectant for car.
                                    But before we find the best solution, it’s important to clearly understand why car
                                    disinfection is essential.</p>
                                <p><b>It keeps you safe</b></p>
                                <p>Bacteria, viruses and other pathogens are indiscriminate in whom they infect. They
                                    can potentially invade your car as much as they can affect you. Therefore, it is
                                    essential to pay close attention to your car’s hygiene as well because the pathogens
                                    in air can directly impact you when you commute regularly. One of the most effective
                                    ways to ensure that is to opt for a car air purifier or a car air disinfectant,
                                    which safeguards you from bacteria, virus, fungi and various other fatal pathogens
                                    that are present in car air.</p>
                                <p><b>It keeps your family safe</b></p>
                                <p>Cars are an intermediate step to your destination, especially for your loved ones who
                                    have not stepped out of your home’s safety since months. Hence, you should be as
                                    cautious inside it as you are outdoors. Car disinfection isn’t limited to just
                                    disinfecting your car’s high-touch surfaces. You also need to ensure your family is
                                    breathing uncontaminated air by employing disinfectants for cars.</p>

                                <p>The need for a water softener arises from our everyday struggles with hard water
                                    problems. If we opt for a good quality water softener that uses ion-exchange
                                    process, then other than adding salt to it periodically, the overall maintenance is
                                    quite low. But how do you get to know when the salt is to be added? We have collated
                                    a few important questions, which help you decide when to add salt, how to check the
                                    salt level and what happens if you forget to top up.</p>
                                <p><strong>Top factors impacting salt usage in your water softener</strong></p>
                                <p>The easiest way to replenish your water softener’s salt supply is to keep a track of
                                    the schedule when you last refilled it. But the schedule also depends on a few
                                    important factors like</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Hardness level of water in your home: </strong>The amount of hardness in
                                        the water that is supplied to your home influences how often your water softener
                                        must regenerate. The area where water is harder will cause the resin to exhaust
                                        faster and thus needs to be cleaned often, this means that more brine solution
                                        and salt needs to be added.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Water usage in your home: </strong>If during a month, the usage of water
                                        in your house if more than usual, you may have to add salt to the softener
                                        sooner than usual.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Type and age of water softener: </strong>The type of water softener you
                                        use, its size and its age also define faster or slower need for refilling of
                                        salt.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>How to Find Out If Your Water Softener Is Running Low On Salt?</strong></p>
                                <p>For those who do not have a regular schedule for refilling the salt, there is an
                                    obvious factor that indicates the softener is running low on salt – the difference
                                    in water quality. Once you start using a water softener the water quality in your
                                    home evidently improves. And it becomes very easy to notice the change in quality.
                                    You will start noticing the common hard water issues like soap scum, dishes taking
                                    longer than usual to get cleaned, soap not lathering well during shower, dull
                                    clothes, rough hair, dry skin, etc. If you begin to notice these problems, it is
                                    time to refill the salt in your water softener.</p>
                                <p><strong>Checking the salt level in the water softener</strong></p>
                                <p>To check the salt level in your water softener, first, locate the brine
                                    chamber.&nbsp;Brine chamber is where a highly concentrated solution of salt or
                                    potassium is stored. In some water softeners like Aqua Pura Bathroom Water Softener,
                                    the
                                    brine
                                    chamber is transparent and can be easily located. Open the lid on top of the chamber
                                    and check. If you see water at the bottom of the tank, it is time to add salt to it.
                                    Ensure that you manually scratch any salt that might be sticking to the walls of the
                                    brine chamber to avoid build-up.</p>
                                <p><strong>Is it bad to let your water softener run out of salt?&nbsp;</strong></p>
                                <p>Yes, it can cause damage to your faucets and fixtures while causing brine tank to
                                    overflow if you are not careful.</p>
                                <p><strong>What happens if you keep using the water softener without salt?</strong></p>
                                <p>If you forget to add salt to the water softener when it is due, the softening process
                                    will get affected and you will get hard water in your home. Also, not adding salt
                                    for long will saturate the water softening resin with hard minerals.</p>
                                <p><strong>How much salt should be added to a water softener?</strong></p>
                                <p>It is always recommended to keep your brine chamber at least one-quarter full of
                                    salt. At all times, the salt level should be above the water.</p>
                                <p>An automatic water softener can take care of automatic regeneration and brine refill
                                    without any manual intervention. Aqua Pura Autosoft, which has these features and
                                    uses
                                    many other functions through the microprocessor-controlled method to make hard water
                                    soft.</p>

                                    dealing with hard water in your home.

                                <p><strong>What is the Life Expectancy of a Water Softener?</strong></p>
                                <p>If properly maintained, water softeners can last from 10 to 15 years.</p>
                                <p><strong>Can you Drink Softened Water?</strong></p>
                                <p>While there is no verdict to say soft water is safe or unsafe to drink, in countries
                                    where drinking water comes from multiple sources like borewell, municipal supply
                                    water etc., it is advisable to drink only purified water.
                                <p><b>How do I know if my water softener’s salt level is low?</b></p>
                                <p>There is an obvious factor that indicates the softener is running low on salt – the
                                    difference in water quality. Once you start using a water softener the water quality
                                    in your home evidently improves. And it becomes very easy to notice the change in
                                    quality. You will start noticing the common hard water issues like soap scum, dishes
                                    taking longer than usual to get cleaned, soap not lathering well during shower, dull
                                    clothes, rough hair, dry skin, etc. If you begin to notice these problems, it is
                                    time to refill the salt in your water softener.</p>
                                <p><b>Does my water softener need service?</b></p>
                                <p>If your water pressure is dropping significantly and your water softener is sounding
                                    like it is constantly running, then your water softener may not be in a great
                                    condition and needs maintenance.</p>

                                <p><strong>How do I know what size of water softener I need for my home?</strong></p>
                                <p>As a rule, you should ideally multiply the number of people in your home by 80, the
                                    average number of gallons of water a person uses per day. Further, multiply that
                                    number by the grains of hardness detected in your water after you have tested it.

                                <p><strong>Does it matter what kind of salt I use in my water softener?</strong></p>
                                <p>Water softeners work more efficiently with sodium chloride or potassium chloride. It
                                    is easily available in the market in cubes or pellets form. Sodium chloride is also
                                    preferred due to its lower price.</p>
                                <p><b>Will using a water softener improve the quality of my hair and skin?</b></p>
                                <p>Hard water contains minerals that absorb the skin’s natural oils, breaking down the
                                    skin’s natural barrier. Constant use of hard water will lead to dry skin and may
                                    also lead to various skin conditions such as eczema. Hard water also makes your hair
                                    frizzy and dry for the same reason resulting in thin hair and an itchy scalp.</p>
                                <p>The reason why a water softener is essential for your hair and skin health is once
                                    hard water is conditioned/softened, the harmful minerals will not be able to damage
                                    your hair and skin. In addition to this, softened water also helps to prevent soap
                                    scum, which can clog your skin pored leaving a scummy residue on your skin and hair.
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>How much does a good water softener cost?</strong></p>
                                <p>A water softener’s price depends on its functionality and usage. These days, many
                                    water filters are passed on as water softeners. One should be careful while
                                    selecting a water softener for their homes.
                                <p><strong>Why Chose Aqua Pura Water Softener?</strong></p>

                                    <li>It is very important to have a well-ventilated facility, so make sure you are in
                                        a well-ventilated area when you clean your home.</li>
                                    <li>Microfibre cloths are also considered more effective at removing soil and dirt
                                        from surfaces but need to be changed frequently to avoid cross-contamination.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Use mops and buckets to clean floors and marble tiles using a disinfectant

                                <p>With the Unlock 4.0 in place, more and more people have started stepping out of their
                                    homes for daily routines, work and even special occasions. Due to safety reasons,
                                    personal vehicles have become a preferred choice of commuting compared to the option
                                    of public cabs.</p>
                                <p>While people are wary of the possible health threats inside their houses and
                                    outdoors, they tend to overlook their personal vehicles, which could be a breeding

                                <p>One of the easiest ways of car disinfection is using a powerful disinfectant for car.
                                    But before we find the best solution, it’s important to clearly understand why car
                                    disinfection is essential.</p>
                                <p><b>It keeps you safe</b></p>
                                <p>Bacteria, viruses and other pathogens are indiscriminate in whom they infect. They
                                    can potentially invade your car as much as they can affect you. Therefore, it is
                                    essential to pay close attention to your car’s hygiene as well because the pathogens
                                    in air can directly impact you when you commute regularly. One of the most effective
                                    ways to ensure that is to opt for a car air purifier or a car air disinfectant,
                                    which safeguards you from bacteria, virus, fungi and various other fatal pathogens
                                    that are present in car air.</p>

                                    have not stepped out of your home’s safety since months. Hence, you should be as
                                    cautious inside it as you are outdoors. Car disinfection isn’t limited to just
                                    disinfecting your car’s high-touch surfaces. You also need to ensure your family is
                                    breathing uncontaminated air by employing disinfectants for cars.</p>

                                <p>The need for a water softener arises from our everyday struggles with hard water
                                    problems. If we opt for a good quality water softener that uses ion-exchange
                                    process, then other than adding salt to it periodically, the overall maintenance is
                                    quite low. But how do you get to know when the salt is to be added? We have collated
                                    a few important questions, which help you decide when to add salt, how to check the
                                    salt level and what happens if you forget to top up.</p>
                                <p><strong>Top factors impacting salt usage in your water softener</strong></p>
                                <p>The easiest way to replenish your water softener’s salt supply is to keep a track of
                                    the schedule when you last refilled it. But the schedule also depends on a few
                                    important factors like</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Hardness level of water in your home: </strong>The amount of hardness in
                                        the water that is supplied to your home influences how often your water softener
                                        must regenerate. The area where water is harder will cause the resin to exhaust
                                        faster and thus needs to be cleaned often, this means that more brine solution
                                        and salt needs to be added.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Water usage in your home: </strong>If during a month, the usage of water
                                        in your house if more than usual, you may have to add salt to the softener
                                        sooner than usual.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Type and age of water softener: </strong>The type of water softener you
                                        use, its size and its age also define faster or slower need for refilling of
                                        salt.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>How to Find Out If Your Water Softener Is Running Low On Salt?</strong></p>
                                <p>For those who do not have a regular schedule for refilling the salt, there is an
                                    obvious factor that indicates the softener is running low on salt – the difference
                                    in water quality. Once you start using a water softener the water quality in your
                                    home evidently improves. And it becomes very easy to notice the change in quality.
                                    You will start noticing the common hard water issues like soap scum, dishes taking
                                    longer than usual to get cleaned, soap not lathering well during shower, dull
                                    clothes, rough hair, dry skin, etc. If you begin to notice these problems, it is
                                    time to refill the salt in your water softener.</p>
                                <p><strong>Checking the salt level in the water softener</strong></p>
                                <p>To check the salt level in your water softener, first, locate the brine
                                    chamber.&nbsp;Brine chamber is where a highly concentrated solution of salt or
                                    potassium is stored. In some water softeners like Aqua Pura Bathroom Water Softener,
                                    the
                                    brine
                                    chamber is transparent and can be easily located. Open the lid on top of the chamber
                                    and check. If you see water at the bottom of the tank, it is time to add salt to it.
                                    Ensure that you manually scratch any salt that might be sticking to the walls of the
                                    brine chamber to avoid build-up.</p>
                                <p><strong>Is it bad to let your water softener run out of salt?&nbsp;</strong></p>
                                <p>Yes, it can cause damage to your faucets and fixtures while causing brine tank to
                                    overflow if you are not careful.</p>
                                <p><strong>What happens if you keep using the water softener without salt?</strong></p>
                                <p>If you forget to add salt to the water softener when it is due, the softening process
                                    will get affected and you will get hard water in your home. Also, not adding salt
                                    for long will saturate the water softening resin with hard minerals.</p>
                                <p><strong>How much salt should be added to a water softener?</strong></p>
                                <p>It is always recommended to keep your brine chamber at least one-quarter full of
                                    salt. At all times, the salt level should be above the water.</p>
                                <p>An automatic water softener can take care of automatic regeneration and brine refill
                                    without any manual intervention. Aqua Pura Autosoft, which has these features and
                                    uses
                                    many other functions through the microprocessor-controlled method to make hard water
                                    soft.</p>

                                <p>Unanswered questions around any technology or product can get a consumer to make an
                                    uninformed purchase decision. It can also ruin the experience of a user in many
                                    ways. When it comes to water softeners, we got you covered. We have compiled the top
                                    10 questions, which we hope will answer most of your queries about water softeners.
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>How do I know if I have hard water supply at home?</strong></p>
                                <p>Minerals and sediment abound in the local water supply, which can damage pipes,
                                    sinks, and even your hair and skin. So, ask yourself these questions to understand
                                    the need for a water softener for your home:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Is your laundry getting scratchy and stiff?</li>
                                    <li>Are you noticing scale build-ups in your tubs and sinks?</li>
                                    <li>Is your washing machine wearing off sooner than expected?</li>
                                    <li>Do your hair and scalp feel itchy?</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>If Yes is the answer to any of these questions, there is a good chance you are
                                    dealing with hard water in your home.

                                <p><strong>What is the Life Expectancy of a Water Softener?</strong></p>
                                <p>If properly maintained, water softeners can last from 10 to 15 years.</p>
                                <p><strong>Can you Drink Softened Water?</strong></p>
                                <p>While there is no verdict to say soft water is safe or unsafe to drink, in countries
                                    where drinking water comes from multiple sources like borewell, municipal supply
                                    water etc., it is advisable to drink only purified water.
                                <p><b>How do I know if my water softener’s salt level is low?</b></p>
                                <p>There is an obvious factor that indicates the softener is running low on salt – the
                                    difference in water quality. Once you start using a water softener the water quality
                                    in your home evidently improves. And it becomes very easy to notice the change in
                                    quality. You will start noticing the common hard water issues like soap scum, dishes
                                    taking longer than usual to get cleaned, soap not lathering well during shower, dull
                                    clothes, rough hair, dry skin, etc. If you begin to notice these problems, it is
                                    time to refill the salt in your water softener.</p>
                                <p><b>Does my water softener need service?</b></p>
                                <p>If your water pressure is dropping significantly and your water softener is sounding
                                    like it is constantly running, then your water softener may not be in a great
                                    condition and needs maintenance.</p>

                                <p><strong>How do I know what size of water softener I need for my home?</strong></p>
                                <p>As a rule, you should ideally multiply the number of people in your home by 80, the
                                    average number of gallons of water a person uses per day. Further, multiply that
                                    number by the grains of hardness detected in your water after you have tested it.

                                <p><strong>Does it matter what kind of salt I use in my water softener?</strong></p>
                                <p>Water softeners work more efficiently with sodium chloride or potassium chloride. It
                                    is easily available in the market in cubes or pellets form. Sodium chloride is also
                                    preferred due to its lower price.</p>
                                <p><b>Will using a water softener improve the quality of my hair and skin?</b></p>
                                <p>Hard water contains minerals that absorb the skin’s natural oils, breaking down the
                                    skin’s natural barrier. Constant use of hard water will lead to dry skin and may
                                    also lead to various skin conditions such as eczema. Hard water also makes your hair
                                    frizzy and dry for the same reason resulting in thin hair and an itchy scalp.</p>
                                <p>The reason why a water softener is essential for your hair and skin health is once
                                    hard water is conditioned/softened, the harmful minerals will not be able to damage
                                    your hair and skin. In addition to this, softened water also helps to prevent soap
                                    scum, which can clog your skin pored leaving a scummy residue on your skin and hair.
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>How much does a good water softener cost?</strong></p>
                                <p>A water softener’s price depends on its functionality and usage. These days, many
                                    water filters are passed on as water softeners. One should be careful while
                                    selecting a water softener for their homes.
                                <p><strong>Why Chose Aqua Pura Water Softener?</strong></p>
