            abroad like NSF & WQA of USA.<br><br>

            With millions of satisfied customers, this home-grown brand that was started off by Mr. Mahesh Gupta, an IIT
            Kanpur alumnus, is the most trusted one in the category, across the globe. The largest manufacturer of RO
            Water Purifiers, Aqua Pura has diversified its product portfolio, over the years. Aqua Pura now offers a

                                    about our daily jobs. While it is safest to stay home, we do need to step out time

                                <p>With the Unlock 4.0 in place, more and more people have started stepping out of their
                                    homes for daily routines, work and even special occasions. Due to safety reasons,
                                    personal vehicles have become a preferred choice of commuting compared to the option
                                    of public cabs.</p>
                                <p>While people are wary of the possible health threats inside their houses and
                                    outdoors, they tend to overlook their personal vehicles, which could be a breeding
                                    ground for bacteria and viruses.</p>
                                <p><b>Importance of car disinfection</b></p>
                                <p>One of the easiest ways of car disinfection is using a powerful disinfectant for car.
                                    But before we find the best solution, it’s important to clearly understand why car
                                    disinfection is essential.</p>
                                <p><b>It keeps you safe</b></p>
                                <p>Bacteria, viruses and other pathogens are indiscriminate in whom they infect. They
                                    can potentially invade your car as much as they can affect you. Therefore, it is
                                    essential to pay close attention to your car’s hygiene as well because the pathogens
                                    in air can directly impact you when you commute regularly. One of the most effective
                                    ways to ensure that is to opt for a car air purifier or a car air disinfectant,
                                    which safeguards you from bacteria, virus, fungi and various other fatal pathogens
                                    that are present in car air.</p>
                                <p><b>It keeps your family safe</b></p>
                                <p>Cars are an intermediate step to your destination, especially for your loved ones who
                                    have not stepped out of your home’s safety since months. Hence, you should be as
                                    cautious inside it as you are outdoors. Car disinfection isn’t limited to just
                                    disinfecting your car’s high-touch surfaces. You also need to ensure your family is
                                    breathing uncontaminated air by employing disinfectants for cars.</p>
